Hi,welcome to my website, and nice to e-meet you! My name is Xianglin Su, and I go by Cici.

I've been always passionate about how scientific reasoning and business reasoning converge to drive core decisions. With 3 over years of professional experience as a researcher at Guangzhou Daily News, I bring a unique skill combination of gather information and data analysis, which enables me to grasp the core problem and come up with a good idea for government consultation.

If describe my personality in a few words, it would be curiosity and focus. I am curious about the world, good at retrieving information, and have a good ability to resist pressure. I personally like reading, especially to think about problems from the underlying logic behind things, I also like to trace the evolution of things with a historical perspective, and I also like to use lateral thinking for comparative analysis.

I am interested in using quantitative methods to study problem. I have experience in several academic projects and have (co)authored several English and Chinese papers. I have a passion for utilizing various tools to boost my research, such as R, Python, SQL and etc.

In my personal time, I'm an enthusiast for tennis ball(2.5) and badminton.
